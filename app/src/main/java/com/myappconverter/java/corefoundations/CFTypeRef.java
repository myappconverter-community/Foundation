 * @Overview All other Core Foundation opaque types derive from CFType. The functions, callbacks, data types, and constants defined for
 *           CFType can be used by any derived opaque type. Hence, CFType functions are referred to as “polymorphic functions.” You use
 *           CFType functions to retain and release objects, to compare and inspect objects, get descriptions of objects and opaque types,
 *           and to get object allocators.
